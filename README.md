# Bsc Mathematics Thesis

We are in the Big Data era, in which companies are constantly generating a great deal
of information and, since the new architectures allow it, these data can be easily stored at
low cost. As a consequence of the above, it is common to hear the term Machine Learning,
which is used to designate the set of techniques capable of obtaining value from such data
by combining statistics, probability and current computing power.

There are many who have developed Machine Learning applications or have implemented
this type of techniques such as large technology companies (IBM, Amazon, Google) or
well-established communities of free software.
In the market we can  nd a wide variety of commercial products and libraries that
implement Machine Learning techniques. Therefore, we can ask ourselves some questions
about their characteristics; which ones produce the best results, what bene ts do some
bookstores have over others, what are their advantages? limitations?....


This work aims to perform an analysis of some implementations of learning algorithms,
discussing the di erences and similarities between them, their e ciency, requirements for
use, etc. In particular, we will focus on those provided by the software communities, since,
being open source, are the most accessible for the user.

Key words:
- Machine learning.
- Linear regression.
- Data analysis.
- Python.
- R.
